# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component

![Design preview for the 3-column preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This was a component I built for practice using the above resources

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

To build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My Experience

- Used Flexbox, viewport units, and mediaa queries to more accurately capture the responsive nature of this component. I think I could have completed it faster if I took a proper mobile first approach so I will try to focus on that in my next challenge.

- Im starting to better understand how careful I must be assigning widths and heighs to certain elements as they can start to throw alot of things out of wack
